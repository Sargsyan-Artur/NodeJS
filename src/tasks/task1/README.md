# PREREQUISITES:
1. Install the latest LTS (Long Term Support) version of Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/), by any
   available means (.exe, nvm, brew, etc.).
2. Check in the console (terminal) that the Node.js installation was done properly by running the
   following commands node -v or node -version.
3. Create a repo for your homework tasks on Github (https://github.com/) or git.epam.com.
4. Provide your mentor with the link to the repo and add read access permissions.
5. Create package.json by running the following commands npm init or npm init -y.
6. Install globally or locally npm package nodemon (https://github.com/remy/nodemon) to dev
   dependency.
7. Get ready to watch the lectures and do the homework tasks to study the basic principles and
   approaches of development server-side applications with Node.js.
   TASK 1.1
   Write a program which reads a string from the standard input stdin, reverses it and then writes it to
   the standard output stdout.
   • The program should be started from npm script via nodemon (i.e. npm run task1).
   • The program should be running in a stand-by mode and should not be terminated after the
   first-string processing.
   • For example:
   TASK 1.2
   Write a program which should do the following:
   • Read the content of csv file from ./csv directory. Example: https://epa.ms/nodejs19-hw1-ex1
   • Use the csvtojson package (https://github.com/Keyang/node-csvtojson) to convert csv file to
   json object.
   • Write the csv file content to a new txt file.
   Use the following format: https://epa.ms/nodejs19-hw1-ex2.
   • Do not load all the content of the csv file into RAM via stream (read/write file content line by
   line).
   • In case of read/write errors, log them in the console.
   • The program should be started via npm script using nodemon (i.e. npm run task2).
   TASK 1.3
   Rewrite the above-mentioned programs to use babel (https://babeljs.io/) and ES6 modules.
   EVALUATION CRITERIA
2. Task 1.1 is fulfilled to the full extent.
3. Task 1.2 is fulfilled to the full extent; the file is loaded fully into the RAM.
4. Task 1.2 is fulfilled to the full extent; the file is not loaded fully in the RAM (pipeline method
   https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_stream_pipeline_streams_callback).
5. All the tasks are fulfilled to the full extent (Task 1.1, Task 1.2, Task 1.3)
